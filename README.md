## Notebooks

The notebooks should be run in the following order:
For the Glacial ice:
1. Downloading_main_datasets.ipynb
2. Data_resolution.ipynb
3. methods_sulfate_deposition.ipynb
4. EDML_sulfate_conductivity.ipynb
5. EDC_sulfate_deposition_new.ipynb
   EDML_sulfate_deposition.ipynb
   GISP2_sulfate_deposition.ipynb
   NEEM_sulfate_deposition.ipynb
   NGRIP_sulfate_deposition.ipynb
6. Main_notebook_bipolar_eruptions.ipynb

For the Holocene ice:
1. methods_sulfate_deposition.ipynb
2. Sigletal2013_NEEM.ipynb
   Sigletal2013_WAIS.ipynb

The notebook: Maps.ipynb can be run independently.

References to data sets, and studies that these scripts are based on, are included in the master thesis, that will be available on the PICE website.

## Excel file

The Excel file Results_MA_100k_volcanism.xlsx contains results of: Sulfate depositions, stratospheric aerosol loadings, latitudinal origins and comments to 253 bipolar eruptions predefined by Svensson 2023.
